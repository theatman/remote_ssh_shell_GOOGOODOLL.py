# remote_ssh_shell_GOOGOODOLL.py  (Version 1.0 - July 2021)
# Shell to access SSH servers and run remote commands.
#
# Questions to: dolores@infosecpath.com
# Lots of this code received the immense collaboration of a great Python wizard: Juan Camilo Corena (former Google software engineer).
#
# This script can allow you to send common commands to an SSH remote server such as:
# whoami, id, ls, pwd, cat (as in cat /etc/passwd), wget, rm, cp, mv, ls -la, curl (and many more). 
# You can't change directories, but you can do something like this if you know the file exists:
# cat /home/tom/Documents/sample.txt

# IMPORTANT: Credentials for the remote server you're trying to connect to are necessary to run this script.

# HOW TO USE:
# You can add the IP address of the SSH server you're trying to connect to on Line 55.
# You can add the SSH username on Line 55.
# You will need to enter the password, but after running this script!!!
# To run:
# $ python3 remote_ssh_shell_GOOGOODOLL.py
# To end session type "quit" or hit Ctrl-C
